Overview
The Movie Recommendation System uses collaborative filtering methods to suggest movies to users. It analyzes user behavior (ratings, viewing history) and makes predictions based on similarities between users or items (movies). This system helps users discover new movies they might like, enhancing their overall viewing experience.

Features
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on similarities between users.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on similarities between movies.
Hybrid Recommender: Combines user-based and item-based methods for improved accuracy.
Scalable: Handles a large dataset of movies and user ratings efficiently.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook (optional, if used for development)
Flask (optional, if a web application is developed)

Dataset

The system uses the MovieLens dataset, specifically the latest version with ratings and movie metadata. This dataset contains movie ratings from users and information about movies (genres, release year, etc.).
